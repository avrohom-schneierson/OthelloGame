Simple project to play the board game Othello against the computer.
Game begins by asking for the difficulty the user wants and then starts the game at that difficulty. 
User enters the row and column of where they would like to place their piece on their turn.
If it is a legal move then the game places their piece there and flips all relevant pieces according to the Othello rules. 
The program then goes and based on the difficulty either does the best move for that turn, or looks ahead 2 or 4 turns to find the overall best move.
Game continues until board is full or there is no legal move for either player and the winner is then displayed.
User has option to play again as many times as they want.
Stats are displayed at the end of the game.
Created for school project in 2nd semester of CS.
